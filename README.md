Simple app that uses an api to grab random cat images that you can rate 1-10.
The program uses a MYSQL database to store your cat ratings along with their file location.
You can store up to 200 images in your cat image directory, but of course can change how many you 
want to allow at the top of the program's code.

Below is an image of the app in action:
